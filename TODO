- grok n_desc:  many/all? fields are only for undefined type, some are only for MH_OBJECT, some are only for in-memory.
- are there any useful STAB types to track?  funcs/symbols found in stab, but not exported?
- handle kexts, static libs, shared caches, kernel caches
- relocations?
- grok MH flags/effects, noting unusual ones when found, recording?
-- determine if SECT symbol is text/data....
- LC_FUNCTION_STARTS (compressed) (can contain funcs with no symbol table entry)
- LC_ROUTINES (init funcs)?
- LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB (verify we're using right, record)
- LC_NOTE?
- LC_BUILD_VERSION
- FUNC_DEC

LINKEDIT -> export trie....

-- stackshot using LC_FUNCTION_STARTS? (....)
-- mod stub_helper/etc..
-- unwinding table
